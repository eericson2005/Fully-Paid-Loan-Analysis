<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I worked with a team of three classmates and Dr. Aric LaBarr of North Carolina State University to analyze Lending Club loan data to determine what qualities make a “good borrower”. Upon investigation of the dataset, we decided to separate our analysis into the categories of loan-related factors, credit history, personal demographics, and financial indicators. I assumed responsibility for financial indicators and performed my analysis using Python. <br/>
<br/>
This project served as an opportunity for me to test my functional programming abilities. I had been learning about functions and their uses in my programming class, and I wanted to try my hand at creating my own functions. As you’ll see in my individual Jupyter notebook, I created a complex function for creating groups of visualizations for different combinations of loan status and loan purpose. This function enabled me to very quickly perform the rest of my analysis on the data, as all I had to do was enter the necessary arguments into my feature visualization function. <br/>
<br/>
I also created a function to calculate the total number of loans in each of the statuses, which enabled me to report the percentage each combination of loan status and purpose made up of the total number of loans. <br/>
<br/>
My endeavors in functions with this project greatly increased not only my confidence in my programming skills but also in my ability to apply knowledge from my classes to real world scenarios, a technique I’m confident I will only continue to become better at. <br/>
<br/>
Included in the README for this repository are links to the Jupyter Notebook I performed my analysis within, a PowerPoint presentation of our findings as a team, and an in-depth report of our investigation. Additionally, I have included an individual technical report that details my specific contributions to the project.<br/>
<br/>
If any of the links in the README don’t work, please email me at ericson@uark.edu and I’ll adjust the permissions for the documents. The University of Arkansas will unfortunately not allow me to indefinitely share my documents publicly through the student OneDrive. Alternatively, you can download the raw file directly.
